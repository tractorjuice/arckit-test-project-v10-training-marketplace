# ArcKit Test Project: UK Government Training Marketplace Platform

**Project Type**: Platform Design Toolkit (PDT) Demonstration
**Version**: v10
**Status**: Demo Repository
**Platform Type**: Multi-Sided Ecosystem Platform

## Overview

This test repository demonstrates the **Platform Design Toolkit** command (`/arckit.platform-design`) for designing a UK Government training marketplace platform.

### Platform Vision

**Civil Service Learning Platform** - A multi-sided platform connecting:
- **Supply Side**: Training providers (private sector, universities, professional bodies)
- **Demand Side**: Civil servants seeking professional development
- **Supporting Entities**: Line managers, HR teams, learning & development teams, Cabinet Office Government Skills & Curriculum Unit

### Why This Is a Platform (Not a Marketplace)

**Network Effects**:
- More training providers → More course variety → More civil servants
- More civil servants → More revenue for providers → More providers
- Data network effects → Better recommendations → Better matches

**Transaction Cost Reduction**:
- **Search costs**: Centralized discovery vs scattered websites
- **Information costs**: Standardized course data, verified reviews
- **Negotiation costs**: Pre-approved frameworks, standard pricing
- **Coordination costs**: Automated booking, calendar integration
- **Enforcement costs**: Quality ratings, dispute resolution

### Platform Design Toolkit (PDT) Application

This project will demonstrate all **8 PDT Canvases**:

1. **Ecosystem Canvas** - Map all entities and their relationships
2. **Entity-Role Portraits** - Deep dive into training providers, civil servants, line managers
3. **Motivations Matrix** - Identify synergies and conflicts
4. **Transactions Board** - Core transactions (browse courses, book training, rate courses, approve requests)
5. **Learning Engine Canvas** - Data capture and learning loops
6. **Platform Experience Canvas** - User journeys for each side
7. **MVP Canvas** - Minimum viable platform scope
8. **Platform Design Canvas** - Complete platform strategy

## Next Steps for Testing PDT

1. **Create architecture principles**: `/arckit.principles Create cloud-first principles`
2. **Analyze stakeholders**: `/arckit.stakeholders Analyze stakeholders for Civil Service Learning Platform`
3. **Define requirements**: `/arckit.requirements Create requirements for training marketplace`
4. **Design platform strategy**: `/arckit.platform-design Design Civil Service Learning Platform using 8 PDT canvases`
5. **Create Wardley map**: `/arckit.wardley Build vs buy for platform components`
